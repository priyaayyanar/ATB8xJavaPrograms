What is it?  | SOAP is a protocol for              |  REST is an architecture style for
               communication between applications  |  designing communication interfaces.

Design       | SOAP API exposes the operation.    |  REST API exposes the data.

Transport    |  SOAP is independent and can work  |  REST works only with HTTPS.
Protocol     |  with any transport protocol.      |

Data format  | SOAP supports only XML data exchange. | REST supports XML, JSON, plain text, HTML.

Performance  | SOAP messages are larger,          |  REST has faster performance due to smaller
                which makes communication slower. |  messages and caching support.

Scalability  | SOAP is difficult to scale.        | REST is easy to scale.
                The server maintains state by     | Itâ€™s stateless, so every message is processed
                storing all previous messages     | independently of previous messages.

Use case   |  SOAP is useful in legacy            | REST is useful in modern applications
