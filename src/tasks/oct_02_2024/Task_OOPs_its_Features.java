    /* Class & Objects:
    -> Class is a blueprint or template of an object.
    -> We can create 'n' number of objects from a class.
    -> Class is user defined data type which defines its attributes(data members) and behaviours(data functions)
    -> Object is an instance of a class.
    -> Objects are real time(run-time) entity.
    -> An object can represent a person, place or any other item.
    -> All data members and member functions of the class can be accessed with the help of objects.
    -> Objects are allocated memory space whenever they are created.
     */

    /* OOPs and Features:
    -> Object-oriented programming, or OOPs, is a programming model which breaks down a problem in terms of
        classes and objects.
    -> OOPs allows the creation of several instances of a class called objects, hence facilitating code reuse.

     Feature of OOPs:
     There are 4 pillors of OOPs:
     1. Abstraction
     2. Polymorphism
     3. Inheritance
     4. Encapsulation
